[![CI](https://github.com/chethan62/holesail-gui/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chethan62/holesail-gui/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A desktop GUI for [Holesail](https://github.com/holesail/holesail) — the peer-to-peer
TCP/UDP tunnel. Share any local port with the world, or connect to someone else's
tunnel, from a friendly window instead of the CLI.

Built with **Tauri v2** (Rust + system webview) and a **plain-Node service worker**.

## Platforms

| Platform | Status | Deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| **Linux** | ✅ fully working | `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage`, pacman, flatpak manifest |
| **Windows** | ✅ builds via CI | `.msi`, `.exe` (NSIS) — needs Node 18+ on the machine |
| **Android** | ✅ backend works (bare runtime) — arm64 APK | debug APK — see the [Android](#android) section |
| macOS | code-compatible, untested here | `.dmg`/`.app` via `tauri build` on a Mac |

The three primary targets are built automatically by the GitHub Actions
workflow in `.github/workflows/build.yml` (artifacts on every push /
`workflow_dispatch`).

```

Why a separate Node worker? `holesail` depends on native addons
(`sodium-native`, `udx-native`) that are prebuilt for the **Node ABI**. Running
them inside a webview/Electron process breaks on ABI mismatch. The worker runs
under the system `node` binary, so the addons load as-is; the Rust backend only
proxies JSON-RPC over stdio.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (`node` on PATH) — for development and for the
  Windows/macOS packages; the **Linux** packages embed the Bare runtime, so
  end users don't need Node at all
- Rust toolchain (`cargo`) for Tauri
- Linux: `webkit2gtk-4.1` + `gtk3` dev packages (Tauri prerequisites;
  see [Tauri docs](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/))

## Run (development)

```bash
npm install          # installs holesail (worker dep) + @tauri-apps/cli
npm run dev          # tauri dev — builds the Rust backend and opens the window
```

## Test

```bash
npm test             # E2E: spawns the real service worker, starts a server on
                     # the DHT, connects a client, stops both, asserts protocol
```

The test talks to the exact same `service-worker.js` the GUI uses, so a green
`npm test` verifies the full backend chain (validation → holesail → hyperdht →
real tunnel).

## Build a release bundle

```bash
npm run build        # prepares resources, then tauri build (deb + rpm + AppImage on Linux)
```

`build` first runs `scripts/prepare-resources.mjs`, which assembles a lean
`dist-resources/` folder (the Node service worker + a **production-only**
`node_modules` with `holesail` and its native addons, pruned to the current
platform's prebuilds, ~38 MB) and then bundles it into the installers:

- **Linux:** `.deb` and `.rpm` put the binary in `/usr/bin` and the resources in
  `/usr/lib/holesail-gui/` — `find_worker` resolves them via `resource_dir()`.
  The AppImage target needs FUSE; on FUSE-less machines (containers/CI) and on
  distros whose newer toolchain trips linuxdeploy's bundled `strip`
  (`.relr.dyn` errors), build it with:

  ```bash
  NO_STRIP=1 APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 npx tauri build --bundles appimage
  ```

  Or skip it entirely with `npx tauri build --bundles deb,rpm`.

**Arch Linux (pacman)** — verified build in `packaging/arch/`:

```bash
./packaging/arch/build.sh        # -> packaging/arch/holesail-gui-<ver>-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
sudo pacman -U packaging/arch/holesail-gui-*.pkg.tar.zst
```

Installs the binary + worker + `node_modules` into `/usr/lib/holesail-gui/` with
a launcher at `/usr/bin/holesail-gui` (binary and resources in the same dir, so
Tauri's `resource_dir()` resolves without bundler patching).

**Flatpak** — manifest in `packaging/flatpak/` (built on the GNOME platform,
which ships WebKitGTK 4.1 — the freedesktop `webkit2gtk-4.1` extension does
not exist on flathub):

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform//47 org.gnome.Sdk//47
./packaging/flatpak/build.sh     # builds + installs io.holesail.gui (user)
flatpak run io.holesail.gui
```

> Note: the flatpak manifest is written but **not verified in this repo's CI
> environment** (needs `flatpak-builder` + the SDK runtimes).
- **macOS / Windows:** `npm run build` produces `.dmg`/`.app` and `.msi`/`.exe`
  respectively with the same resource layout.

**Packaged-app requirements:** the GUI prefers the **bundled Bare runtime**
(same engine as the Android build — no Node needed). Linux packages ship it;
Windows/macOS installers still spawn `node` from PATH, so those end-user
machines need Node.js 18+ installed (documented in the release notes).
Switching Windows/macOS to the embedded runtime is future work once verified
there.

## Using the app

**Share a port** — pick a local port (e.g. 3000), optionally a custom 32+ char key,
toggle private/public. A session card appears with the `hs://s000…` connection
string — hit **Copy** and send it to whoever needs access.

**Connect** — paste a connection string (`hs://s000…` private or `hs://0000…`
public; secure mode is auto-detected from the prefix). The tunnel is exposed on
your localhost port.

Sessions can be paused/resumed/stopped; the event log at the bottom shows what
the worker is doing.

## Android

An Android project is scaffolded with `tauri android init` (already done — see
`src-tauri/gen/android/`, regenerated on demand; the mobile capability lives in
`src-tauri/capabilities/mobile.json`).

**Build an APK** (on a machine with Android Studio / the SDK+NDK):

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android # or all four ABIs
ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk npm run build:android   # prepare bundle + glue + build
# or step by step:
node scripts/prepare-resources.mjs --bare --target android-arm64 --out dist-resources-android
node scripts/android-glue.mjs
ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk npx tauri android build --apk --debug
```

**How the backend works on Android.** The worker is the exact same
`service-worker.js`, but instead of the system `node` binary it runs under
**Bare**, holepunch's JS runtime (the same one upstream holesail uses for its
own Android build):

1. `prepare-resources.mjs --bare --target android-arm64` assembles
   `dist-resources-android/`: the worker + a production `node_modules` pruned
   to the `android-arm64` `.bare` prebuilds of `sodium-native`/`udx-native`,
   plus the prebuilt `bare` runtime binary (fetched from the
   `bare-runtime-android-arm64` npm package — no cross-compiling needed).
2. `scripts/android-glue.mjs` wires everything into the generated project:
   - copies the bundle into the APK assets (`app/src/main/assets/bare/`) and
     injects `BareAssets.kt`, a small Kotlin extractor that copies the assets
     into `filesDir/bare` on first launch (Android assets are not real
     filesystem paths);
   - ships `bare` as a jniLibs library (`libholesail_bare.so`) — SELinux
     forbids apps (targetSdk ≥ 26) from exec'ing files in their own data dir,
     but *does* allow exec of the extracted APK lib dir (`apk_data_file`);
   - bundles `libc++_shared.so` (the `udx-native` addon links the C++ STL,
     which is not present on Android 10+) and forces
     `extractNativeLibs="true"` so those files land on disk at install.
3. In Rust, `worker_command()` under `cfg(target_os = "android")` locates the
   native lib dir via `/proc/self/maps`, spawns
   `<libdir>/libholesail_bare.so service-worker.js` with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
   pointing at the bundle — same JSON-RPC over stdio, same protocol, same UI.
   If the bundle is missing the app still renders with a "worker offline"
   banner instead of crashing.
4. A tiny foreground service (`HoleService`, injected by the glue) keeps the
   app process — and therefore the worker — alive when the app is
   backgrounded; without it Android freezes backgrounded apps and silently
   kills active tunnels. The service is started while the UI is visible,
   stopped when the task is swiped away, and shows a low-importance
   "Tunnel worker active" notification (notification permission is requested
   on Android 13+).

`npm test` runs the protocol test under node; `npm run test:bare` runs the
same test suite against a linux-x64 bare bundle, verifying the whole chain
(worker → holesail → addons → real DHT tunnel) on the bare runtime.

**Verified end-to-end on an emulator** (x86_64, API 35) **and on real arm64
hardware** (OnePlus 13R): the app spawns the bare worker, the UI shows
"worker online", server sessions started from the app's own UI are reachable
from a desktop client over the public DHT, and data sent through the tunnel
arrives on the device — in both directions.

> The SDK installed in this repo's sandbox lives at
> `/home/chethan/.reasonix/global-workspace/android-sdk` (not in `$HOME`,
> which is read-only). `ANDROID_USER_HOME` must also point at a writable dir
> or `sdkmanager`/gradle will fail.

## Security notes

- Private connection strings are credentials — treat them like SSH keys.
- The GUI runs a local service worker; the renderer is sandboxed
  (`withGlobalTauri`, CSP `default-src 'self'`, `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`) and
  can only talk to it through the whitelisted `rpc` command. Untrusted values
  (keys, hosts, logs) are rendered with `textContent`, never injected as HTML.
- **Recent keys are stored in plaintext in the webview's localStorage** (up to
  10 entries) for convenience. They're only readable by local processes with
  access to your app profile, but if that's a concern, use the "clear" button
  or avoid saving private keys you care about.
